Fetch API
The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network).
 It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful
  and flexible feature set.
  Fetch provides a generic definition of Request and Response objects (and other things involved with
   network requests). This will allow them to be used wherever they are needed in the future,
    whether it's for service workers, Cache API, and other similar things that handle or modify requests
     and responses, or any kind of use case that might require you to generate your responses
      programmatically
   (that is, the use of computer program or personal programming instructions).
